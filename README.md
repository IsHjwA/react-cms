This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

跨域代理步骤：
1  安装依赖：cnpm i http-proxy-middleware -D
2  src目录下创建setupProxy.js文件配置相关代码




## redux  （三个核心概念）
1、action 触发行为（主要作用：触发数据改变的行为）
2、reducer  （作用：改变store中的数据）
3、store  （共享数据的存储中心）
安装步骤：
    1、cnpm i redux -S //创建store   
       cnpm i react-redux -S   //将store与react组件关联起来
    2、创建目录及文件：src\store\index.js
    3、index.js中创建store
        import { createStore } from 'redux'

        let initState = {
            a:1
        }

        //reducer是一个纯函数
        function reducer(state,payload){
            state = initState  //赋初始值
            state.a = payload
            return state
        }

        //创建store
        const store = createStore(reducer)
        export default store
